The objective of the food calorie predictor is to estimate the calorie content of food photos, this study on food calorie prediction applies deep learning and image classification methods. The project uses an Inception v3 model that has already been trained, together with TensorFlow Keras and ImageDataGenerator, to train and test the model's predictive power for the calorie content of food photos. To enhance the model's performance, the dataset utilized in the project is compiled from Kaggle and Google and enhanced using a variety of methods. The food calorie prediction project may find use in a variety of contexts, including business analysis, weight control, and healthcare. Accuracy, scalability, and the potential to increase nutritional knowledge make the initiative a significant addition to the worldwide campaign to encourage healthy eating practices and enhance public health outcomes.
